```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Dependent variable
**Check: is.timeSeries(Y)**:
ACF test: 

Y=dependent variable

lag.max= depth of the autocorrelation test

plot : do you want a plot output

```{r}
stats::acf(Y,lag.max=17,plot=TRUE)
```


**IF is.timeSeries(Y)==FALSE:**


continuous:
-response is continuous or count data that can be modeled with a normal distribution

Logistic:
-response is binary (1 or 0)



Count:
-count is bounded, or has a low probability of success
normal linear model used

*(|Count)*:

`P(success=SMALL)`:
-Poisson regression w/ log link
`total count=HIGH`:
-Poisson regression
`count=level of a given category`:
-multinomial response model | categorical data analysis
`ELSE:`
-binomial regression



**NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHEN TO PUT IN SUBSETS OF THE TYPES OF THESE REGRESSIONS**



#Independent variables

*(|continous dependent)*:


`count(predictor)==1`:
-simple regression

`count(predictor)>1`:
-multinomial regression

*(|Logistic dependent)*:

m=number of trials in an observation:

` m>5:`
-Logistic regression


`m<5`:
-binary logistic regression
  -most common, each observation ?is a single bernoulli trial?
  
*(|Count)*:

PUT RESTRICTIONS ON INDEPENDENT VARIABLES HERE (not sure if there are any)


DO YOU WANT:

hypothesis testing

Dan notes:

iterative process, flow chart

start tree up close, then zoom out

## Model Building Strategy

*(|simple regression)*:


EDA:

1. MISSING DATA

`base::summary(data)`

-check for NA, (see *missing data*)

2. CORRELATION 

`GGallly::ggpairs(data)`
or
`corrplot::corrplot(base::cor(data))`


-visually check for correlations

3. TRANSFORMATION TESTS
